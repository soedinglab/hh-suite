   HH-suite for sensitive sequence searching version 2.0.8 (January 2012)

 (C) Johannes Soeding, Michael Remmert, Andreas Hauser, Andreas Biegert 2012

We are very grateful for bug reports! 
Please contact us at soeding@genzentrum.lmu.de

The hhsuite contains in file hhprefilter.C code adapted from Michael 
Farrar (http://sites.google.com/site/farrarmichael/smith-waterman). 
His code is marked in the file hhprefilter.C. For the copy right of that 
code, please see the LICENSE file that comes with HHsuite.

six times over other SIMD implementations. Bioinformatics. 2007, 23:156-61.
Many posthumous thanks to Michael Farrar for his great code!

*****************************************************************************
 Installation
*****************************************************************************

1. Downloading

Download the sources from ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/HH-suite/, e.g.

$ mkdir ~/programs/hh/
$ cd ~/programs/hh/
$ wget ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/HH-suite/hhsuite-latest.tar.gz

Unzip and untar

$ tar -xzvf hhsuite-latest.tar.gz

This will unpack the sources to hhsuite-<VERSION>.

2. Compilation 

The following dependencies exist: perl, libpng, libz

$ cd hhsuite-<VERSION>/
$ make

Compilation produces by default static binaries. If you encounter missing
library errors, also make sure you have the static versions installed, e.g.
glibc-static, zlib-static and libpng-static. Package names and whether they are
automatically installed or varies with distribution.

A dynamically linked version of the programs can be compiled with:

$ make all

On Mac OS X only dynamic linking is supported.

To compile code for CPUs without SSE3 you can compile with NO_SSE3 set:
$ make NO_SSE3=1
To see whether your CPU supports SSE3 you can check the output of:
$ grep sse3 /prc/cpuinfo)


3. Installation

Either install in current directory:

$ make install

Or set INSTALL_DIR to the base directory (absolute path), e.g. /usr/local,
where you want to install:

$ make install INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local


4. Set paths 

4.1. In your shell set environment variable HHLIB to $INSTALL_DIR/lib/hh, 
e.g (for bash, zsh, ksh):

$ export HHLIB=/usr/local/lib/hh

HHsearch and HHblits look for the column state library file cs219.lib
and the context library file context_data.lib in $HHLIB/data/. The hh-suite
perl scripts also read HHLIB to locate 

4.2. Specify paths to BLAST, PSIPRED, PDB, DSSP etc. in 
$INSTALL_DIR/lib/hh/scripts/HHPaths.pm
where they are read by the perl scripst in hh-suite.

4.3 For dynamic builds only

To use a dynamic build, in the lib subdirectory must either be in the system
library path, e.g. the ones configured in /etc/ld.so.conf on linux, or a variable
must be set for the run-time linker to find the libraries.

Assuming INSTALL_DIR was set to /opt/hhsuite, on linux LD_LIBRARY_PATH must
be set, e.g. in bourne shell format (bash, zsh etc):

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/hhsuite/lib

on Mac OSX DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set, e.g.:

$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/hhsuite/lib


5. Download Databases

Download current databases from our FTP-server:
ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/HH-suite/hhblits_dbs/
ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/HH-suite/hhsearch_dbs/

Either uniprot20 or nr20 is sufficient. 


*****************************************************************************
* Usage
*****************************************************************************


For performing a single search iteration of HHblits, run HHblits with the 
following command:

$ hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -n 1 -d <database-basename>

For generating an alignment of homologous sequences:

$ hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -oa3m <result-alignment> -d <database-basename>

You can get a detailed list of options for HHblits by running HHblits with the "-h" option.

Example (if HHLIB is set):

$ hhblits -d $HHLIB/hhblits_dbs/uniprot20_02Sep11 -i $HHLIB/data/query.a3m
